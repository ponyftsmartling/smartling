If the overall market situation is unfavourable and the required margin of your positions is insufficient, BitMart Futures may have to arrange forced liquidation for your positions.

You need to read the rules and guidance for BitMart Futures market carefully, including but not limited to the Terms and Conditions for BitMart Futures Market. By using BitMart Futures services, you represent that you have read, understand, and accept all terms and conditions for BitMart Futures market. You also represent that you understand and accept the mechanism, trading principles, and market risks of future trading.\n3. You understand and agree that under extreme market situations, you may find it extremely difficult to close your positions. An example is when your profits rank first in the effective leverage PNL of the entire Futures market, and your counterparty’s position’s insurance fund is insufficient to cover the loss caused by unfilled liquidated orders.\n4. You understand and agree that, upon changes in the laws and regulations of Cayman Islands, changes of trading rules and mechanisms, or emergency measures adopted, BitMart may determine and inform you in advance that the open positions you hold have to be closed out. Nevertheless, your margin and profits will still be cashed.\n5. You understand and agree that, upon the occurrence of events beyond the control of BitMart, including but not limited to earthquake, flood, fire, other Force Majeure factors, or computer system delays and communication system failures, your order may not be filled or may not be completed. You will be responsible for the resulting loss, if any.\n6. You understand and agree that, hedging transactions, being similar to speculative trading, are also subject to high risks arising from extreme price fluctuations. You will be responsible for the resulting loss, if any.\n7. You understand and agree that, if you do not complete KYC process for real name authentication, or you fail to use Google verification, it may affect the security of your margin for future trading.",
